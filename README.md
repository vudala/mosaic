# mosaic
### What does it do?
This program takes two inputs: a PPM image - P3 or P6 - and a set of tiles, that are also PPM images.
And then rebuilds the image using the tiles that were given.

### Example
Thats the original image, a painting made by Vincent van Gogh: Starry Night (1889)

<original image>

And thats the result when it's piped to the program with a set of flower tiles:

<resulting image>
